# Gaming Notes 🎮  

I've been a gamer since 1982 – here’s a collection of my favorite games, notes, and little memories.  

## 🕹️ All-time favorites
- **The Elder Scrolls series** – exploring Tamriel never gets old    
- **Day of the Tentacle** – funniest point & click ever  
- **TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge** – pure arcade vibes  

## 📚 What’s here
- Notes about retro & modern games  
- Lists of recommendations  
- Maybe some scripts or configs related to gaming setups  

Games are not just entertainment – they’ve always been part of my life.
