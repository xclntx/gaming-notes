# Retro Arcade Vibes 🕹️

## Childhood Favorites
- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade, 1989)  
- Double Dragon  
- Metal Slug  

## Modern Retro
- TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge (2022) – best couch co-op vibes  
- Streets of Rage 4  

## Notes
Arcade games are about:
- **Fast fun** (pick-up & play)  
- **Co-op** (the best memories are shared)  
- **Replayability** (mastery instead of grinding)

Retro never dies – it just respawns with better graphics.
