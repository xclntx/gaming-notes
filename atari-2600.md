# Atari 2600 Memories 🕹️

The Atari 2600 was my first contact with console gaming.  
Simple games, but unforgettable experiences.  

## Classics
- **Space Invaders** – endless waves, pure reflexes  
- **Pitfall!** – one of the earliest platformers  
- **Adventure** – proto-RPG with dragons and keys  
- **Pac-Man (2600 version)** – infamous for its flickering, but still iconic  
- **Combat** – tanks and planes, pure 2-player fun

## Why it matters
- **Accessibility**: gaming entered the living room.  
- **Foundation**: many genres were born here.  
- **Nostalgia**: blocky graphics, but endless imagination.
