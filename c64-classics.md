# C64 Classics ðŸŽ¹

The Commodore 64 was my entry into gaming.  
Here are the games that shaped me â€“ and why they still matter.  

## Action
- **International Karate+ (IK+)**  
  Fast-paced, 3-player mode â€“ legendary for its time.  
- **Bruce Lee**  
  Platformer with martial arts, co-op mode decades ahead of its time.  

## Strategy & Thinking
- **Defender of the Crown**  
  Blending strategy, sword fighting, and castle sieges.  
- **The Last Ninja**  
  Isometric action-adventure, stunning visuals on 8-bit hardware.  

## Arcade Ports
- **Bubble Bobble**  
- **Ghostsâ€™n Goblins**  
- **Pac-Man** (countless clones but always addictive)

## Why it matters
- **Community spirit**: swapping disks, typing listings from magazines.  
- **Coding curiosity**: PEEK, POKE, BASIC â€“ the start of real hacking.  
- **Legacy**: C64 wasnâ€™t just a computer, it was a movement.
